# Web Development Fundamentals

This repository documents my learning and refresher journey through core web development fundamentals.

The purpose of this repository is to strengthen my understanding of foundational frontend concepts, document what I learn clearly, and create a reference I can revisit while building projects and preparing for interviews.

## Topics Covered
- HTML5 semantic elements and accessibility
- CSS Flexbox and Grid
- JavaScript ES6+ fundamentals
- Asynchronous JavaScript and DOM manipulation
- Git workflow and version control
- Technical interview preparation
- Job search and junior developer readiness

## How This Repository Is Organized
Each topic has its own folder containing:
- A concise explanation of key concepts
- Practical examples and notes
- Common mistakes and best practices

## Why I’m Doing This
I believe strong fundamentals are more important than knowing a specific framework.  
This repository reflects my approach to learning: understand the core concepts first, apply them in small projects, and document the process clearly.

## Status
This repository is actively updated as I continue learning and refreshing my skills.
